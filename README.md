# Pizza Menu React Project Documentation

Welcome to the Pizza Menu React project! This project serves as a learning exercise in building a dynamic menu for a pizza restaurant using React. Throughout this project, you'll learn various fundamental concepts of React, including components, props, JSX, conditional rendering, and more.

## Key Learning Points:

Components: You'll learn how to create reusable components to structure your application efficiently.

Props: Utilize props to pass data between components, ensuring a one-way data flow and maintaining the immutability of props.

JSX: Learn the syntax for writing JSX, a JavaScript extension that allows for the creation of React elements in a more intuitive manner.

Styling Components: Explore different methods for styling React components, including inline styles and CSS classes.

Rendering Lists: Master the technique of rendering dynamic lists of data in your React application, allowing for flexible and scalable UIs.

Conditional Rendering: Implement conditional rendering based on certain criteria, using logical operators like && and the ternary operator to control what content is displayed.

Extracting JSX into Components: Learn how to refactor JSX code into separate components to improve code organization and maintainability.

Destructuring Props: Utilize ES6 destructuring syntax to extract specific properties from props, enhancing code readability.

React Fragments: Use React Fragments to group multiple elements without introducing unnecessary parent elements in the DOM.

Setting Classes and Text Conditionally: Dynamically apply CSS classes and text content based on certain conditions, enhancing the user experience.

## Installation and Usage:

To install and use the Pizza Menu React project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone <repository-url>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
